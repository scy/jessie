In 2018, [@scy](https://github.com/scy) will move into a custom-built Fiat Ducator campervan and live in it.
This repository consists of documentation about the van and its systems, about plans that I've made and plans that I've already rejected, but it also contains software thatâ€™s used for controlling various parts of the van.

You can also check out [my (German) YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/timwohnt%C3%BCberall).
I haven't updated it for far too long though; more recent updates can be found on my Twitter account [@timwohnt](https://twitter.com/timwohnt).
