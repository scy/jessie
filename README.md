In 2018, [@scy](https://github.com/scy) will move into a custom-built campervan and live in it. This repository consists of documentation about the van and its systems, but also contains software thatâ€™s used for controlling it.

The documentation is still a bit lacking; sorry about that. 
Currently, my focus is on building the van to live in it. 
Documentation comes after that.
