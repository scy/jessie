# Internal network

Jessie is equipped with six Gigabit Ethernet Keystone jacks in several locations. 
All of them connect to a central patch panel in the tech cabinet at the third seat.

From this 8-port patch panel, additional two cables run to the small cabinet next to the bed. 
Those are currently not connected, the cables end in bare wires.

## Ports on the patch panel

Port 1 is the one closest to the sliding door, port 8 closest to the left wall of the vehicle.
