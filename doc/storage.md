# Storage

(As in, physical storage, not hard drives.)

## What I want

Standardized storage containers that are stackable, robust and likely to still be available to buy years from now.

## Suggestions

[My tweet asking for suggestions](https://twitter.com/timwohnt/status/956952441072832514) resulted in two suggestions:

* [Sortimo](https://www.sortimo.de/) L-Boxx (also known under different brand names, e.g. Bosch in the US)
* [systainer](https://www.tanos.de/007/De/HOME/PRODUKTBEREICHE/systainer.html) by Tanos (_also_ known under different brand names, especially Festool)

Jonas [suggested](https://twitter.com/lsanoj/status/957050853894090752) [this article that compares them](https://toolguyd.com/best-modular-tool-box-system/).

## Decision

Since both of these "professional" systems are awesome, but really expensive, I finally settled for something different: 
[Euro containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_container), also known as KLT boxes. 
They are

* inexpensive (less than 10 €)
* stackable
* also available in half and quarter size (still stackable!)
* available with lids or folding or meshed
* for sale at ordinary hardware stores.

## Load securing

Currently, the ~5 euro boxes I have are simply placed on non-slip mats in my van's cargo area. 
In the future, I want to secure them with airline lashing tracks. 
These will be attached to the floor/wall/ceiling of the cargo space using insert nuts.
